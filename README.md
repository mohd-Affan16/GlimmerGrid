#GlimmerGrid

Welcome to GlimmerGrid, an exciting e-commerce web project crafted with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript! 
This is my personal passion project where I‚Äôve explored these skills hands-on,
turning ideas into a functional shopping site with a unique design.

##Overview

GlimmerGrid is a beginner-friendly e-commerce platform designed to showcase products and categories in an engaging way.
Currently at version 1.0.00, it‚Äôs a work in progress with ongoing improvements, hosted right here in this repository.

##File Structure

The project is organized into a clear folder and file setup:
fontawesome/: Contains the fontawesome.min.css and all.min.css files, providing the iconic elements (e.g., cart, search icons) that enhance the navigation and user interface.

img/: Houses all the images used in the project, including product photos like phones, watches, T-shirts, and goggles, ensuring a visual appeal for the product grid.

login_page/: Includes Welcome_page.html, Sign_in.html, and Login.html, offering a starting point for user authentication (though not fully implemented in this version, meaning the login functionality is present but not yet complete or functional).

index.html: The main HTML file that structures the site, featuring the header, main content, and footer.

style.css: The CSS file that styles the site with a purple and yellow theme, hover effects, and responsive layouts.

main.js: The JavaScript file that powers dynamic features like the product grid, tab navigation, and real-time search functionality.

##Features
GlimmerGrid shines with a range of thoughtfully designed features that bring the e-commerce experience to life:
Interactive Navigation: A tabbed navbar with animated underlines (using CSS classes like underline_on/off) allows seamless switching between Home, Categories, Cart, Search, and Login sections. Each tab is clickable, with a dynamic underline effect that highlights the active section, making navigation intuitive and visually appealing.
Dynamic Product Grid: Displays a variety of products‚Äîsuch as the Nothing CMF Phone 1, Fossil watches, T-shirts, and goggles‚Äîwith hover effects (scaling and glowing shadows via CSS transitions). The grid is generated dynamically using JavaScript, complete with ‚ÄúBuy Now‚Äù buttons that invite user interaction, though they‚Äôre placeholders for now.
Smart Search: A real-time search bar that filters products as you type, powered by JavaScript event handling and enhanced with CSS animations. It includes a dropdown list that appears on focus, hides unmatched items with smooth transitions, and even shows a ‚ÄúNot Found‚Äù message if no results match‚Äîadding practicality and polish.
Tabbed Content Switching: The site uses JavaScript to toggle content containers (e.g., Home, Categories, Search) based on nav tab selection, ensuring a clean and organized layout. This feature keeps the interface clutter-free while letting users explore different sections effortlessly.
Product Categorization: A dedicated Categories tab displays grouped products (e.g., Mobiles, Watches, Clothes, Goggles) with their own hover effects, offering a structured way to browse items and hinting at future category expansion.
Vibrant Design: A striking purple (#9333ea) and yellow (#facc15) color scheme, complemented by smooth transitions and box shadows, creates an eye-catching aesthetic. The design includes custom styling for buttons, inputs, and product cards, ensuring a cohesive and enjoyable browsing experience.

##Challenges & Learnings
Building GlimmerGrid came with its share of hurdles‚Äîdebugging JavaScript for the search filter and aligning CSS hover effects took some trial and error. These challenges taught me the value of breaking problems into smaller steps and leveraging online resources, fueling my growth as a coder.
